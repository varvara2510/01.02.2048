In our country, the primary education is mandatory for all and it is funded by the government unless someone wants to send his kids to a private English medium school. The secondary and tertiary education systems are also managed and run by the government and private organisations. The government controlled educational institutes are less costly and the curriculums are presented and monitored by the education board. On the other hand, the private educational institutes are bound to include some of the national curriculums and they mostly follow their own syllabus. In all universities and in many colleges, higher education is offered in English. The technical and vocational colleges and universities are also popular in our country and they mostly offer certification and degree in selected technical and practical skill related fields. The private universities are approved by the Government controlled bodies and they have to follow their rules very strictly. I am happy to see many changes brought to our educational system in the last few years and innovation and quality modern education is a vision our country has already started implementing.", "It will take me 7-8 months more or so to finish my graduation and then I will try to get admitted to a foreign university which has a reputation for better education. There I will complete my Master’s degree and would get involved in a job. Besides doing the job I have plans to get enrolled in a professional MBS course to further my education. If time allows, I also wish to do some research based courses related to my academic background and interest."],

In fact, the majority of people used to ride bicycles to travel to and from their offices at that time. But, the motorized vehicles have become more popular these days and this trend has decreased the prevalence of bicycles.

Busy lifestyle, faster speed of motorized vehicles and our apathy to get involved in physical activities have forced us to use a bicycle less often. Once in a while, I ride a bicycle and that's primarily to have fun and not to travel. Personally, I more often use a car than a bicycle because the former one is faster and more comfortable to ride in.", "Bicycles are cheap, have almost zero maintenance costs, and good for the environment and for our health. Since it doesn't take much physical labour, children, youth and senior citizens alike can ride it without any hassle. The health benefits of riding a bicycle are unparalleled and that's why people from all age groups should consider this as their primary means of transportation.", "Bicycles have far more benefits than cars except for the fact that a car is faster. The most important advantage of riding a bicycle is that it keeps us healthy. Bicycles do not pollute the air and they are environment-friendly. They are cheap and requires no costly maintenances or services. While cars take larger spaces to be parked into, bicycles do not. Considering the environmental consequences, bicycles could be a great replacement for motorised vehicles in our hometown."],
